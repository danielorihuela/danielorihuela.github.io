Hi! I'm Daniel Orihuela, a Software Engineer interested in Cybersecurity, Cryptography, Algorithms, Distributed Systems and AI.

I have three years of professional experience in the fintech and evoting space. Currently focused on building cryptographic libraries. Nonetheless, I am always striving to improve my knowledge around making secure and privacy friendly products with great user experiences.

On my free time I enjoy improving my craftmanship, learning martial arts, reading books and playing video games.

Aspiring member of fsociety.
