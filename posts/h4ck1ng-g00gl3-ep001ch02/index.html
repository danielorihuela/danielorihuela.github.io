<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href=https://h4ck1ng.google/>H4ck1ng G00gl3</a> is a series of security challenges published on <strong>October 2022</strong> where the only way to win is to think like a hacker. In this post, I explain how I solved <strong>ep001 challenge 02</strong>.
This challenge is about <strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>.</p>

<p>After opening the challenge, we get a zip file containing an executable with the name <code>wannacry</code>.</p>
<p>As a first step, I extracted the strings from the executable with <code>strings wannacry</code>. After analyzing the output, I saw the URL <code>https://wannacry-killswitch-dot-gweb-h4ck1ng-g00gl3.uc.r.appspot.com//</code>. If you visit this page, you will see the following sentence: &ldquo;Our princess is in another castle.&rdquo;. At that point, I recalled that the real wannacry had a kill switch in the binary. To stop the attack, you only needed to register a domain with the hardcoded name. For some reason, I thought that disconnecting from the internet or creating a local website for that domain could modify the binary execution result. That was not the case. I was going down the rabbit hole. I was stuck there thinking for a while until I asked the community.</p>
<p>The community told me to look at the executable code and try to execute the interesting part. With that in mind, I searched for how to disassemble a binary in Linux. I found <code>objdump</code>, a command that allows printing the assembly code of the binary. The following image shows a fragment of the assembly code.</p>

<p>With the assembly code in my power, I wrote down the functions and how they are related. Interestingly enough, the <code>main</code> function does not call any other function. Besides, the only function not being called anywhere in the code is one called <code>print</code>. Probably, that is what the community was referring to with the second part of the hint.</p>
<p>I found gdb, a tool designed to debug C/C++ programs. Moreover, it can execute functions present in the binary. It is simple.</p>

<p>As you can see, executing the <code>print</code> function gives us a new URL. Visiting the URL shows the following website.</p>

<p>After clicking the button, the flag will appear. With that, we completed the challenge.</p>
