<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href=https://h4ck1ng.google/>H4ck1ng G00gl3</a> is a series of security challenges published on <strong>October 2022</strong> where the only way to win is to think like a hacker. In this post, I explain how I solved <strong>ep005 challenge 03</strong>. Category <strong>Misc</strong>.</p>

<p>For this challenge, we don&rsquo;t have any data. We have to find the secret message hidden in the episodes. I opened all the episodes in different browser tabs and looked at each introduction. I searched for colours, letters, keywords and any information I could see on the screen. Besides, I was carefully listening to the storyteller. After a couple of hours of watching the introductions in a loop, I asked the community for help.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a message in morse. In each episode&rsquo;s introduction, around the time when a person enters and sits on the chair, some high-frequency sounds start to play. It never occurred to me that it could be morse. In any case, I decreased the video speed to 0.25 and started taking notes.</p>

<p>I transformed morse into English and copied the link on the browser. It didn&rsquo;t work. I was stuck for a while here checking the episodes and my notes. The problem was that they made a mistake and put the same message in two episodes. I found out by asking the community. After fixing that, I managed to get the last flag.</p>
<p>With that, we completed the challenge and the entire series.</p>
