<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href=https://h4ck1ng.google/>H4ck1ng G00gl3</a> is a series of security challenges published on <strong>October 2022</strong> where the only way to win is to think like a hacker. In this post, I explain how I solved <strong>ep004 challenge 03</strong>. Category <strong>Misc</strong>.</p>

<p>In that challenge, we only have the hint. So, I went ahead to the webpage used in this episode. Next to the &ldquo;FAQs&rdquo; tab, I found the &ldquo;Contributing&rdquo; tab.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, the tab isn&rsquo;t clickable. Moreover, you have to be authenticated to access the URL <a href=https://vrp-website-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/contributing>https://vrp-website-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/contributing</a>. That was a minor inconvenience, but I remember that the <strong>code in challenge two had some layouts of the different web pages</strong>. I returned to it and found the <strong>&ldquo;contributing.hbs&rdquo;</strong> inside the views folder.</p>

<p>This file explains how to get started contributing.</p>

<p>In theory, we only need to clone the repository, modify something, create a branch and push it. Cloning the repository works as expected, but pushing an empty branch will return an error.</p>

<p>Among the output, we can read: &ldquo;remote: Skipping presubmit (enable via push option)&rdquo;. I decided to <strong>enable the presubmit option</strong> and see what happens.</p>

<p>Now, the go command is not found. I installed it on my local machine, but nothing changed. It seems that the <strong>&ldquo;build.sh&rdquo; is executed on the server side, not the client side.</strong> So, I decided to read the script.</p>

<figure class=centered-image><img src=/images/h4ck1ng00gl3/ep004ch03/configure-flags.png>
</figure>
<p>As we can see in the previous images, what it does is rather simple. The scripts initialize a couple of variables and print some information on the screen. However, notice the comment in the &ldquo;configure_flags.sh&rdquo;. <strong>We have to bump the version before pushing a new change. Hence, I created a new commit with a new version.</strong></p>
<figure class=centered-image><img src=/images/h4ck1ng00gl3/ep004ch03/version-changes.png>
</figure>
<p>The output printed the new version &ldquo;0.1.2&rdquo;. What would happen if I try to read the &ldquo;flag&rdquo; file? With that idea, I modified the script.</p>
<figure class=centered-image><img src=/images/h4ck1ng00gl3/ep004ch03/version-prints-flag.png>
</figure>
<p>After creating another commit with this new change and executing the push, we can read the flag in the output. With that, we completed the challenge.</p>
