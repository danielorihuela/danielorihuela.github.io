<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href=https://h4ck1ng.google/>H4ck1ng G00gl3</a> is a series of security challenges published on <strong>October 2022</strong> where the only way to win is to think like a hacker. In this post, I explain how I solved <strong>ep003 challenge 02</strong>. Category <strong>Escape Restricted Shell</strong>.</p>

<p>The description gives us the command to connect to a remote machine.</p>

<p>At this point, we can try winning the game or cheating, as the hint suggests. At first, I tried to play the game for a while, searching for clues on how to cheat it. I could not find a way. I was recovering a lot of coordinates and images that didn&rsquo;t make sense and didn&rsquo;t help me. Later I learned that they are related to the bonus challenge for this episode. After dying a couple of times, the game became tedious, and I didn&rsquo;t find a way to cheat. I asked the community for help. The hint is related to the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/famous-cheat-codes-in-video-games/#:~:text=In%20its%20most%20famous%20form,a%20cakewalk%20with%20the%20code">famous Konami cheat code</a>. After introducing it, we get to another screen where we can input text.</p>

</figure>
<p>Notice that it won&rsquo;t execute any command. We need to do some research. First, I <strong>copied the error output of the command &ldquo;cd ~"</strong> into the Google search engine.</p>

<p>We can try to execute a python function to check if it&rsquo;s a python shell and its version. In that case, I decided to call:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>print <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;asd&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><figure class=centered-image><img src=/images/h4ck1ng00gl3/ep003ch02/shell-is-python3.png>
</figure>
<p>By the given output, we can see that the <strong>shell is running python version 3</strong>. Lucky me, I found a <a href=https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/python/bypass-python-sandboxes#python3>webpage with tricks to scape from restricted python3 shells</a>. That page shows how to access the <strong>builtins</strong> module, for example.</p>

</figure>
<p>The <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html>builtins</a> module gives access to several functions, one of them being the <strong>open</strong> function. That means that we can open a file and read it. We know from past challenges that the flag file is at the root directory, and therefore, we can get the flag with</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>print(len<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>__self__<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>open(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;flag&#39;</span>)<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>read())
</code></pre></div><p>With that, we completed the challenge.</p>
